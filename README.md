## Simple Music Library

This repository contains a demo music library application built with the latest versions of PHP and Laravel.
The project is designed for presentation and portfolio purposes, not for production use.

While the application provides basic functionality for managing and browsing a collection of music,
its primary focus is to showcase code quality, design patterns, and development approach rather than complex business logic.

### Frameworks and Libraries used

- **Laravel 12** working on PHP 8.3.4 
- MySQL 8
- nginx
- Meilisearch as search engine
- Redis for cache
- RabbitMQ as message broker
- Docker and Docker Compose for deployment
- **Backpack 6** for admin panels
- Spatie Laravel Media Library with Backpack support
- Backpack Permission Manager
- AI services (Open Router)
- Swagger for API documentation

### Additional Notes

The use of LLM to provide mock data is for presentation purposes. In real project, it would be more reliable to use
pre-generated seed data.

For simplicity, this project doesn't use development or feature branches.

See DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment instructions.
